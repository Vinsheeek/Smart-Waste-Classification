# ♻️ Smart Waste Classification using Computer Vision

An end-to-end Computer Vision system designed to assist automated waste segregation by classifying waste images into multiple categories using Deep Learning.

---

## Problem Statement

Improper waste segregation is a major environmental challenge. Manual sorting is inefficient, error-prone, and difficult to scale. This project aims to develop an intelligent vision-based system capable of identifying waste categories to support sustainable disposal practices.

## Solution Overview

This system leverages **Transfer Learning** with MobileNetV2 to classify waste images into:

• Cardboard  
• Glass  
• Metal  
• Paper  
• Plastic  
• Trash  

The model is integrated into an interactive **Streamlit web application** for real-time inference.

## Model Architecture

• Backbone: **MobileNetV2 (Pretrained)**  
• Framework: **PyTorch**  
• Technique: **Transfer Learning + Fine-tuning**  
• Input Resolution: **224 × 224**  

Why MobileNetV2?

✔ Lightweight  
✔ Fast inference  
✔ Suitable for real-time applications  
✔ Edge-device friendly
